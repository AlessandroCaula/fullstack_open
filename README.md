Fullstack course project that can be found here: https://fullstackopen.com/en/

- [Part1 - Introduction to React](./part1/)   
    - In this part, we will familiarize ourselves with the React-library, which we will be using to write the code that runs in the browser. We will also look at some features of JavaScript that are important for understanding React.
- [Part2 - Communicating with server](./part2/)
    - Let's continue our introduction to React. First, we will take a look at how to render a data collection, like a list of names, to the screen. 
    - After this, we will inspect how a user can submit data to a React application using HTML forms. 
    - Next, our focus shifts towards looking at how JavaScript code in the browser can fetch and handle data stored in a remote backend server. 
    - Lastly, we will take a quick look at a few simple ways of adding CSS styles to our React applications.
- [Part3 - Programming a server with NodeJS and Express](./part3/)
    - In this part our focus shifts towards the backend, that is, towards implementing functionality on the server side of the stack. We will implement a simple REST API in Node.js by using the Express library, and the application's data will be stored in a MongoDB database. 
    - At the end of this part, we will deploy our application to the internet.
- [Part4 - Testing Express servers, user administration](./part4/)
    - In this part, we will continue our work on the backend. Our first major theme will be writing unit and integration tests for the backend. After we have covered testing, we will take a look at implementing user authentication and authorization.
- [Part5 - Testing React apps](./part5/)
    - In this part we return to the frontend, first looking at different possibilities for testing the React code. 
    - We will also implement token based authentication which will enable users to log in to our application.
- [Part6 - Advanced state management](./part6/)
    - So far, we have placed the application's state and state logic directly inside React components. When applications grow larger, state management should be moved outside React components. In this part, we will introduce the Redux library, which is currently the most popular solution for managing the state of React applications.    
    - We'll learn about the lightweight version of Redux directly supported by React, namely the React context and useReducer hook, as well as the React Query library that simplifies the server state management.
- [Part7 - React router, custom hooks, styling app with CSS and webpack](./part7/)
    - The seventh part of the course touches on several different themes. First, we'll get familiar with React Router. React Router helps us divide the application into different views that are shown based on the URL in the browser's address bar. After this, we'll look at a few more ways to add CSS styles to React applications. 
    - During the entire course, we've used Vite to build all of our applications. It is also possible to configure the whole toolchain yourself, and in this part we will see how this can be done with a tool called Webpack. We shall also have a look at hook functions and how to define a custom hook.
- [Part8 - GraphQL](./part8/)
    - This part of the course is about GraphQL, Facebook's alternative to REST for communication between browser and server.
- [Part9 - TypeScript](./part9/)
    - This part is all about TypeScript: an open-source typed superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft that compiles to plain JavaScript.    
    - In this part, we will be using the tools previously introduced to build end-to-end features to an existing ecosystem, with predefined linters and an existing codebase, while writing TypeScript. After doing this part, you should be able to understand, develop and configure projects using TypeScript.    
    - This part is created by Tuomo Torppa, Tuukka Peuraniemi and Jani Rapo, the awesome developers of Terveystalo, the largest private healthcare service provider in Finland. Terveystalo’s nationwide network covers 300 locations across Finland. The clinic network is supplemented by 24/7 digital services.
- [Part11 - CI/CD](./part11/)
    - So you have a fresh feature ready to be shipped. What happens next? Do you upload files to a server manually? How do you manage the version of your product running in the wild? How do you make sure it works, and roll back to a safe version if it doesn’t?    
    Doing all the above manually is a pain and doesn’t scale well for a larger team. 
    - That’s why we have Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery systems, in short CI/CD systems. In this part, you will gain an understanding of why you should use a CI/CD system, what can one do for you, and how to get started with GitHub Actions which is available to all GitHub users by default.    
    - This module was crafted by the Engineering Team at Smartly.io. At Smartly.io, we automate every step of social advertising to unlock greater performance and creativity. We make every day of advertising easy, effective, and enjoyable for more than 650 brands worldwide, including eBay, Uber, and Zalando. We are one of the early adopters of GitHub Actions in wide-scale production use. Contributors: Anna Osipova, Anton Rautio, Mircea Halmagiu, Tomi Hiltunen.
