This part is all about TypeScript: an open-source typed superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft that compiles to plain JavaScript.

In this part, we will be using the tools previously introduced to build end-to-end features to an existing ecosystem, with predefined linters and an existing codebase, while writing TypeScript. After doing this part, you should be able to understand, develop and configure projects using TypeScript.

This part is created by Tuomo Torppa, Tuukka Peuraniemi and Jani Rapo, the awesome developers of Terveystalo, the largest private healthcare service provider in Finland. Terveystaloâ€™s nationwide network covers 300 locations across Finland. The clinic network is supplemented by 24/7 digital services.

# Part 9

## Part 9a - Background and introduction

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a programming language designed for large-scale JavaScript development created by Microsoft. For example, Microsoft's _Azure Management Portal_ (1,2 million lines of code) and _Visual Studio Code_ (300 000 lines of code) have both been written in TypeScript. To support building large-scale JavaScript applications, TypeScript offers features such as better development-time tooling, static code analysis, compile-time type checking and code-level documentation.

### Main principle

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript, and eventually, it's compiled into plain JavaScript code. The programmer is even able to decide the version of the generated code, as long as it's ECMAScript 3 or newer. TypeScript being a superset of JavaScript means that it includes all the features of JavaScript and its additional features as well. In other words, all existing JavaScript code is valid TypeScript.

TypeScript consists of three separate, but mutually fulfilling parts:

- The language

- The compiler

- The language service

![alt text](assets/image.png)

The _language_ consists of syntax, keywords and type annotations. The syntax is similar to but not the same as JavaScript syntax. From the three parts of TypeScript, programmers have the most direct contact with the language.

The _compiler_ is responsible for type information erasure (i.e. removing the typing information) and for code transformations. The code transformations enable TypeScript code to be transpiled into executable JavaScript. Everything related to the types is removed at compile-time, so TypeScript isn't genuine statically typed code.

Traditionally, _compiling_ means that code is transformed from a human-readable format to a machine-readable format. In TypeScript, human-readable source code is transformed into another human-readable source code, so the correct term would be _transpiling_. However, compiling has been the most commonly used term in this context, so we will continue to use it.

The compiler also performs a static code analysis. It can emit warnings or errors if it finds a reason to do so, and it can be set to perform additional tasks such as combining the generated code into a single file.

The _language service_ collects type information from the source code. Development tools can use the type information for providing intellisense, type hints and possible refactoring alternatives.

### TypeScript key language features

In this section, we will describe some of the key features of the TypeScript language. The intent is to provide you with a basic understanding of TypeScript's key features to help you understand more of what is to come during this course.

__Type annotations__

Type annotations in TypeScript are a lightweight way to record the intended contract of a function or a variable. In the example below, we have defined a `birthdayGreeter` function that accepts two arguments: one of type string and one of type number. The function will return a string.

```js
const birthdayGreeter = (name: string, age: number): string => {
  return `Happy birthday ${name}, you are now ${age} years old!`
}

const birthdayHero = "Jane User"
const age = 22

console.log(birthdayGreeter(birthdayHero, age))
```

__Keywords__

Keywords in TypeScript are specially reserved words that embody designated teleological meaning within the construct of the language. They cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, class names, etc.) because they are part of the syntax of the language. An attempt to use these keywords will result in syntax or semantics error. There are about 40-50 keywords in TypeScript. Some of these keywords include: type, enum, interface, void, null, instanceof etc. One thing to note is that, TypeScript inherits all the reserved keywords from JavaScript, plus it adds a few of its own type-related keywords like interface, type, enum, etc.

__Structural typing__

TypeScript is a structurally typed language. In structural typing, two elements are considered to be compatible with one another if, for each feature within the type of the first element, a corresponding and identical feature exists within the type of the second element. Two types are considered to be identical if they are compatible with each other.

__Type inference__

The TypeScript compiler can attempt to infer the type information if no type has been specified. Variables' types can be inferred based on their assigned value and their usage. The type inference takes place when initializing variables and members, setting parameter default values, and determining function return types.

For example, consider the function `add`:

```js
const add = (a: number, b: number) => {
  /* The return value is used to determine
     the return type of the function */
  return a + b;
}
```

The type of the function's return value is inferred by retracing the code back to the return expression. The return expression performs an addition of the parameters a and b. We can see that a and b are numbers based on their types. Thus, we can infer the return value to be of type `number`.

__Type erasure__

TypeScript removes all type system constructs during compilation.

Input:

```js
let x: SomeType
```

Output:

```js
let x
```

This means that no type information remains at runtime; nothing says that some variable x was declared as being of type `SomeType`.

The lack of runtime type information can be surprising for programmers who are used to extensively using reflection or other metadata systems.

### Why should one use TypeScript?

On different forums, you may stumble upon a lot of different arguments either for or against TypeScript. The truth is probably as vague, it depends on your needs and the use of the functions that TypeScript offers. Anyway, here are some of our reasons behind why we think that the use of TypeScript may have some advantages.

First of all, TypeScript offers _type checking and static code analysis_. We can require values to be of a certain type and have the compiler warn about using them incorrectly. This can reduce runtime errors, and you might even be able to reduce the number of required unit tests in a project, at least concerning pure-type tests. The static code analysis doesn't only warn about wrongful type usage, but also other mistakes such as misspelling a variable or function name or trying to use a variable beyond its scope.

The second advantage of TypeScript is that the type annotations in the code can function as a kind of _code-level documentation_. It's easy to check from a function signature what kind of arguments the function can consume and what type of data it will return. This form of type annotation-bound documentation will always be up to date and it makes it easier for new programmers to start working on an existing project. It is also helpful when returning to work on an old project.

Types can be reused all around the code base, and a change to a type definition will automatically be reflected everywhere the type is used. One might argue that you can achieve similar code-level documentation with e.g. [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/about-getting-started.html), but it is not connected to the code as tightly as TypeScript's types, and may thus get out of sync more easily, and is also more verbose.

The third advantage of TypeScript is that IDEs can provide more _specific and smarter IntelliSense_ when they know exactly what types of data you are processing.

All of these features are extremely helpful when you need to refactor your code. The static code analysis warns you about any errors in your code, and IntelliSense can give you hints about available properties and even possible refactoring options. The code-level documentation helps you understand the existing code. With the help of TypeScript, it is also very easy to start using the newest JavaScript language features at an early stage just by altering its configuration.

### What does TypeScript not fix?

As mentioned above, TypeScript's type annotations and type checking exist only at compile time and no longer at runtime. Even if the compiler does not throw any errors, runtime errors are still possible. These runtime errors are especially common when handling external input, such as data received from a network request.

Lastly, below, we list some issues many have with TypeScript, which might be good to be aware of:

#### Incomplete, invalid or missing types in external libraries

When using external libraries, you may find that some have either missing or in some way invalid type declarations. Most often, this is due to the library not being written in TypeScript, and the person adding the type declarations manually not doing such a good job with it. In these cases, you might need to define the type declarations yourself. However, there is a good chance someone has already added typings for the package you are using. Always check the DefinitelyTyped [GitHub page](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) first. It is probably the most popular source for type declaration files. Otherwise, you might want to start by getting acquainted with TypeScript's [documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html) regarding type declarations.

#### Sometimes, type inference needs assistance

The type inference in TypeScript is pretty good but not quite perfect. Sometimes, you may feel like you have declared your types perfectly, but the compiler still tells you that the property does not exist or that this kind of usage is not allowed. In these cases, you might need to help the compiler out by doing something like an "extra" type check. One should be careful with type casting (that is quite often called type assertion) or type guards: when using those, you are giving your word to the compiler that the value is of the type that you declare. You might want to check out TypeScript's documentation regarding [type assertions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#type-assertions) and [type guarding/narrowing](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html).

#### Mysterious type errors

The errors given by the type system may sometimes be quite hard to understand, especially if you use complex types. As a rule of thumb, the TypeScript error messages have the most useful information at the end of the message. When running into long confusing messages, start reading them from the end.

## Part 9b - First steps with TypeScript

After the brief introduction to the main principles of TypeScript, we are now ready to start our journey toward becoming FullStack TypeScript developers. Rather than giving you a thorough introduction to all aspects of TypeScript, we will focus in this part on the most common issues that arise when developing an Express backend or a React frontend with TypeScript. In addition to language features, we will also have a strong emphasis on tooling.

### Setting things up

Install TypeScript support to your editor of choice. Visual Studio Code works natively with TypeScript.

As mentioned earlier, TypeScript code is not executable by itself. It has to be first compiled into executable JavaScript. When TypeScript is compiled into JavaScript, the code becomes subject to type erasure. This means that type annotations, interfaces, type aliases, and other type system constructs are removed and the result is pure ready-to-run JavaScript.

In a production environment, the need for compilation often means that you have to set up a "build step." During the build step, all TypeScript code is compiled into JavaScript in a separate folder, and the production environment then runs the code from that folder. In a development environment, it is often easier to make use of real-time compilation and auto-reloading so one can see the resulting changes more quickly.

Let's start writing our first TypeScript app. To keep things simple, let's start by using the npm package [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node). It compiles and executes the specified TypeScript file immediately so that there is no need for a separate compilation step.

You can install both ts-node and the official typescript package globally by running:

```
npm install --location=global ts-node typescript
```

If you can't or don't want to install global packages, you can create an npm project that has the required dependencies and run your scripts in it. We will also take this approach.

As we recall from [part 3](../part3/), an npm project is set by running the command `npm init` in an empty directory. Then we can install the dependencies by running

```
npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
```

and setting up `scripts` within the package.json:

```json
{
  // ..
  "scripts": {
    "ts-node": "ts-node"
  },
  // ..
}
```

You can now use `ts-node` within this directory by running `npm run ts-node`. Note that if you are using ts-node through package.json, command-line arguments that include short or long-form options for the `npm run script` need to be prefixed with `--`. So if you want to run file.ts with `ts-node` and options `-s` and `--someoption`, the whole command is:

```bash
npm run ts-node file.ts -- -s --someoption
```

It is worth mentioning that TypeScript also provides an online playground, where you can quickly try out TypeScript code and instantly see the resulting JavaScript and possible compilation errors. You can access TypeScript's official playground [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html).

__NB__: The playground might contain different tsconfig rules (which will be introduced later) than your local environment, which is why you might see different warnings there compared to your local environment. The playground's tsconfig is modifiable through the config dropdown menu.

#### A note about the coding style

JavaScript is a quite relaxed language in itself, and things can often be done in multiple different ways. For example, we have named vs anonymous functions, using const and let or var, and the optional use of `semicolons`. This part of the course differs from the rest by using semicolons. It is not a TypeScript-specific pattern but a general coding style decision taken when creating any kind of JavaScript project. Whether to use them or not is usually in the hands of the programmer, but since it is expected to adapt one's coding habits to the existing codebase, you are expected to use semicolons and adjust to the coding style in the exercises for this part. This part has some other coding style differences compared to the rest of the course as well, e.g. in the directory naming conventions.

Let us add a configuration file `tsconfig.json` to the project with the following content:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions":{
    "noImplicitAny": false
  }
}
```

The `tsconfig.json` file is used to define how the TypeScript compiler should interpret the code, how strictly the compiler should work, which files to watch or ignore, and [much more](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html). For now, we will only use the compiler option [noImplicitAny](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#noImplicitAny), which does not require having types for all variables used.

Let's start by creating a simple Multiplier. It looks exactly as it would in JavaScript.

```js
const multiplicator = (a, b, printText) => {
  console.log(printText,  a * b);
}

multiplicator(2, 4, 'Multiplied numbers 2 and 4, the result is:');
```

As you can see, this is still ordinary basic JavaScript with no additional TS features. It compiles and runs nicely with `npm run ts-node -- multiplier.ts`, as it would with Node.

But what happens if we end up passing the wrong `types` of arguments to the multiplicator function?

Let's try it out!

```js
const multiplicator = (a, b, printText) => {
  console.log(printText,  a * b);
}

multiplicator('how about a string?', 4, 'Multiplied a string and 4, the result is:');
```

Now when we run the code, the output is: `Multiplied a string and 4, the result is: NaN`.

Wouldn't it be nice if the language itself could prevent us from ending up in situations like this? This is where we see the first benefits of TypeScript. Let's add types to the parameters and see where it takes us.

TypeScript natively supports multiple types including `number`, `string` and `Array`. See the comprehensive list [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html). More complex custom types can also be created.

The first two parameters of our function are of type number and the last one is of type string, both types are [primitives](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#the-primitives-string-number-and-boolean):

```ts
const multiplicator = (a: number, b: number, printText: string) => {
  console.log(printText,  a * b);
}

multiplicator('how about a string?', 4, 'Multiplied a string and 4, the result is:');
```

Now the code is no longer valid JavaScript but in fact TypeScript. When we try to run the code, we notice that it does not compile:

![alt text](assets/image1.png)

One of the best things about TypeScript's editor support is that you don't necessarily need to even run the code to see the issues. VSCode is so efficient, that it informs you immediately when you are trying to use an incorrect type:

![alt text](assets/image2.png)

### Creating your first own types

Let's expand our multiplicator into a slightly more versatile calculator that also supports addition and division. The calculator should accept three arguments: two numbers and the operation, either `multiply`, `add` or `divide`, which tells it what to do with the numbers.

In JavaScript, the code would require additional validation to make sure the last argument is indeed a string. TypeScript offers a way to define specific types for inputs, which describe exactly what type of input is acceptable. On top of that, TypeScript can also show the info on the accepted values already at the editor level.

We can create a `type` using the TypeScript native keyword `type`. Let's describe our type `Operation`:

```ts
type Operation = 'multiply' | 'add' | 'divide';
```

Now the `Operation` type accepts only three kinds of values; exactly the three strings we wanted. Using the OR operator `|` we can define a variable to accept multiple values by creating a [union type](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#union-types). In this case, we used exact strings (that, in technical terms, are called [string literal types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#literal-types)) but with unions, you could also make the compiler accept for example both string and number: `string | number`.

The `type` keyword defines a new name for a type: [a type alias](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#type-aliases). Since the defined type is a union of three possible values, it is handy to give it an alias that has a representative name.

Let's look at our calculator now:

```js
type Operation = 'multiply' | 'add' | 'divide';

const calculator = (a: number, b: number, op: Operation) => {
  if (op === 'multiply') {
    return a * b;
  } else if (op === 'add') {
    return a + b;
  } else if (op === 'divide') {
    if (b === 0) return 'can\'t divide by 0!';
    return a / b;
  }
}
```

Now, when we hover on top of the `Operation` type in the calculator function, we can immediately see suggestions on what to do with it:

![alt text](assets/image3.png)

And if we try to use a value that is not within the `Operation` type, we get the familiar red warning signal and extra info from our editor:

![alt text](assets/image4.png)

This is already pretty nice, but one thing we haven't touched yet is typing the return value of a function. Usually, you want to know what a function returns, and it would be nice to have a guarantee that it returns what it says it does. Let's add a return value `number` to the calculator function:

```ts
type Operation = 'multiply' | 'add' | 'divide';

const calculator = (a: number, b: number, op: Operation): number => {
  if (op === 'multiply') {
    return a * b;
  } else if (op === 'add') {
    return a + b;
  } else if (op === 'divide') {
    if (b === 0) return 'this cannot be done';
    return a / b;
  }
}
```

The compiler complains straight away because, in one case, the function returns a string. There are a couple of ways to fix this:

We could extend the return type to allow string values, like so:

```ts
const calculator = (a: number, b: number, op: Operation): number | string =>  {
  // ...
}
```

But now the question is if it's `really` okay for the function to return a string?

When your code can end up in a situation where something is divided by 0, something has probably gone terribly wrong and an error should be thrown and handled where the function was called. When you are deciding to return values you weren't originally expecting, the warnings you see from TypeScript prevent you from making rushed decisions and help you to keep your code working as expected.

One more thing to consider is, that even though we have defined types for our parameters, the generated JavaScript used at runtime does not contain the type checks. So if, for example, the `Operation` parameter's value comes from an external interface, there is no definite guarantee that it will be one of the allowed values. Therefore, it's still better to include error handling and be prepared for the unexpected to happen. In this case, when there are multiple possible accepted values and all unexpected ones should result in an error, the [switch...case](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch) statement suits better than if...else in our code.

The code of our calculator should look something like this:

```ts
type Operation = 'multiply' | 'add' | 'divide';

const calculator = (a: number, b: number, op: Operation) : number => {
  switch(op) {
    case 'multiply':
      return a * b;
    case 'divide':
      if (b === 0) throw new Error('Can\'t divide by 0!');
      return a / b;
    case 'add':
      return a + b;
    default:
      throw new Error('Operation is not multiply, add or divide!');
  }
}

try {
  console.log(calculator(1, 5 , 'divide'));
} catch (error: unknown) {
  let errorMessage = 'Something went wrong: '
  if (error instanceof Error) {
    errorMessage += error.message;
  }
  console.log(errorMessage);
}
```

### Type narrowing

The default type of the catch block parameter `error` is `unknown`. The [unknown](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-0.html#new-unknown-top-type) is a kind of top type that was introduced in TypeScript version 3 to be the type-safe counterpart of `any`. Anything is assignable to `unknown`, but `unknown` isnâ€™t assignable to anything but itself and `any` without a type assertion or a control flow-based type narrowing. Likewise, no operations are permitted on an `unknown` without first asserting or narrowing it to a more specific type.

Both the possible causes of exception (wrong operator or division by zero) will throw an [Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) object with an error message, that our program prints to the user.

If our code would be JavaScript, we could print the error message by just referring to the field [message](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/message) of the object `error` as follows:

```js
try {
  console.log(calculator(1, 5 , 'divide'));
} catch (error) {

  console.log('Something went wrong: ' + error.message);
}
```

Since the default type of the `error` object in TypeScript is `unknown`, we have to [narrow](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html) the type to access the field:

```ts
try {
  console.log(calculator(1, 5 , 'divide'));
} catch (error: unknown) {
  let errorMessage = 'Something went wrong: '
  // here we can not use error.message
  if (error instanceof Error) {
    // the type is narrowed and we can refer to error.message
    errorMessage += error.message;
  }
  // here we can not use error.message
  console.log(errorMessage);
}
```

Here the narrowing was done with the [instanceof](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#instanceof-narrowing) type guard, that is just one of the many ways to narrow a type. We shall see many others later in this part.

### Accessing command line arguments

The programs we have written are alright, but it sure would be better if we could use command-line arguments instead of always having to change the code to calculate different things.

Let's try it out, as we would in a regular Node application, by accessing `process.argv`. If you are using a recent npm-version (7.0 or later), there are no problems, but with an older setup something is not right:

![alt text](assets/image5.png)

So what is the problem with older setups?

### @types/{npm_package}

Let's return to the basic idea of TypeScript. TypeScript expects all globally-used code to be typed, as it does for your code when your project has a reasonable configuration. The TypeScript library itself contains only typings for the code of the TypeScript package. It is possible to write your own typing for a library, but that is rarely needed - since the TypeScript community has done it for us!

As with npm, the TypeScript world also celebrates open-source code. The community is active and continuously reacting to updates and changes in commonly used npm packages. You can almost always find the typings for npm packages, so you don't have to create types for all of your thousands of dependencies alone.

Usually, types for existing packages can be found from the `@types` organization within npm, and you can add the relevant types to your project by installing an npm package with the name of your package with a `@types/` prefix. For example:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/express @types/lodash @types/jest @types/mongoose
```

and so on and so on. The `@types/` are maintained by [Definitely typed](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped), a community project to maintain types of everything in one place.

Sometimes, an npm package can also include its types within the code and, in that case, installing the corresponding `@types/` is not necessary.

> __NB__: Since the typings are only used before compilation, the typings are not needed in the production build and they should `always` be in the devDependencies of the package.json.

Since the global variable `process` is defined by the Node itself, we get its typings from the package `@types/node`.

Since version 10.0 `ts-node` has defined `@types/node` as a peer dependency. If the version of npm is at least 7.0, the [peer dependencies](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#peerdependencies) of a project are automatically installed by npm. If you have an older npm, the peer dependency must be installed explicitly:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/node
```

When the package `@types/node` is installed, the compiler does not complain about the variable `process`. Note that there is no need to require the types to the code, the installation of the package is enough!

### Improving the project

Next, let's add npm scripts to run our two programs `multiplier` and `calculator`:

```json
{
  "name": "fs-open",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.ts",
  "scripts": {
    "ts-node": "ts-node",
    "multiply": "ts-node multiplier.ts",
    "calculate": "ts-node calculator.ts"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "ts-node": "^10.5.0",
    "typescript": "^4.5.5"
  }
}
```

We can get the multiplier to work with command-line parameters with the following changes:

```js
const multiplicator = (a: number, b: number, printText: string) => {
  console.log(printText,  a * b);
}

const a: number = Number(process.argv[2])
const b: number = Number(process.argv[3])
multiplicator(a, b, `Multiplied ${a} and ${b}, the result is:`);
```

And we can run it with:

```bash
npm run multiply 5 2
```

If the program is run with parameters that are not of the right type, e.g.

```bash
npm run multiply 5 lol
```

it "works" but gives us the answer:

```bash
Multiplied 5 and NaN, the result is: NaN
```

The reason for this is, that `Number('lol')` returns `NaN`, which is actually of type `number`, so TypeScript has no power to rescue us from this kind of situation.

To prevent this kind of behavior, we have to validate the data given to us from the command line.

The improved version of the multiplicator looks like this:

```js
interface MultiplyValues {
  value1: number;
  value2: number;
}

const parseArguments = (args: string[]): MultiplyValues => {
  if (args.length < 4) throw new Error('Not enough arguments');
  if (args.length > 4) throw new Error('Too many arguments');

  if (!isNaN(Number(args[2])) && !isNaN(Number(args[3]))) {
    return {
      value1: Number(args[2]),
      value2: Number(args[3])
    }
  } else {
    throw new Error('Provided values were not numbers!');
  }
}

const multiplicator = (a: number, b: number, printText: string) => {
  console.log(printText,  a * b);
}

try {
  const { value1, value2 } = parseArguments(process.argv);
  multiplicator(value1, value2, `Multiplied ${value1} and ${value2}, the result is:`);
} catch (error: unknown) {
  let errorMessage = 'Something bad happened.'
  if (error instanceof Error) {
    errorMessage += ' Error: ' + error.message;
  }
  console.log(errorMessage);
}
```

When we now run the program:

```bash
npm run multiply 1 lol
```

we get a proper error message:

```bash
Something bad happened. Error: Provided values were not numbers!
```

There is quite a lot going on in the code. The most important addition is the function `parseArguments` which ensures that the parameters given to `multiplicator` are of the right type. If not, an exception is thrown with a descriptive error message.

The definition of the function has a couple of interesting things:

```js
const parseArguments = (args: string[]): MultiplyValues => {
  // ...
}
```

Firstly, the parameter `args` is an [array](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#arrays) of strings.

The return value of the function has the type `MultiplyValues`, which is defined as follows:

```js
interface MultiplyValues {
  value1: number;
  value2: number;
}
```

The definition utilizes TypeScript's [Interface](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#interfaces) keyword, which is one way to define the "shape" an object should have. In our case, it is quite obvious that the return value should be an object with the two properties `value1` and `value2`, which should both be of type number.

### The alternative array syntax

Note that there is also an alternative syntax for [arrays](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#arrays) in TypeScript. Instead of writing

```js
let values: number[];
```

We could use the "generic syntax" and write

```js
let values: Array<number>;
```

In this course we shall mostly be following the convention enforced by the Eslint rule [array-simple](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/array-type/#array-simple) that suggests writing the simple arrays with the `[]` syntax and using the `<>` syntax for the more complex ones, see [here](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/array-type/#array-simple) for examples.
